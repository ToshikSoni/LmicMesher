### 1. Packet Structure

- **First version**   
  ```cpp
  struct dataPacket {
      uint32_t counter = 0;
  };
  dataPacket* helloPacket = new dataPacket;
  ```
  - Only carries a single 32‑bit counter; no need for a type tag or union.
  - Only one packet buffer is allocated (no separate return packet).

- **Second version**   
  ```cpp
  struct dataPacket {
      int type = 0; // 0 for counter, 1 for wan packet
      union {
          uint32_t counter = 0;
          uint8_t data[4];
      } data;
  };
  dataPacket* helloPacket = new dataPacket;
  dataPacket* returnPacket = new dataPacket;
  ```
  - Includes a `type` field to distinguish between “counter” packets and raw WAN data.
  - Uses a `union` so the same 4‑byte payload can be interpreted either as a `uint32_t` counter or a 4‑byte array.
  - Allocates both `helloPacket` (outbound) and `returnPacket` (for gateway responses).

### 2. Packet Processing & Printing

- **First version**   
  - `printPacket(dataPacket data)` unconditionally prints `"Hello Counter received nº <counter>"`.
  - `printDataPacket(...)` shows source and size, then iterates over the single `counter` field.

- **Second version**   
  - `printPacket(dataPacket data, uint16_t src)` branches on `data.type`:
    - **Type 0**: prints `DATA:<counter> <src>`  
    - **Type 1**: dumps raw `data.data[i]` bytes.
  - `printDataPacket(...)` shows both the source address and payload size before iterating.

### 3. Gateway vs. Node Logic

- **First version**   
  - No gateway differentiation—every device simply calls:  
    ```cpp
    radio.createPacketAndSend(BROADCAST_ADDR, helloPacket, 1);
    ```
  - Simpler “everyone is a node” model, always broadcasting.

- **Second version**   
  - **Conditional compilation** on `IS_GATEWAY`:  
    - **Gateway** side reads 7 bytes from `Serial`, packages them into `returnPacket`, and sends to a specified node address.  
    - **Node** side finds the closest gateway (`getClosestGateway()`) and sends either to that address or does a broadcast.
  - Optionally adds a gateway role via `radio.addGatewayRole()`.

---

### 4. LoRaMesher Configuration

- **First version**   
  - Hard‑codes `config.loraCs = 18;` etc., and always uses `SX1276_MOD`.  
  - Omits any `SPI.begin` call or `HELTEC` checks.

- **Second version**   
  - Uses `LoraMesherConfig` with conditional pin/SPI setup based on `HELTEC` macro.  
  - Chooses between `SX1262_MOD` or `SX1276_MOD` depending on board.
  - Calls `SPI.begin(...)` explicitly for Heltec boards.

---

### 5. Task Setup & Initialization Order

- **First version**   
  1. `radio.begin(config)`  
  2. `createReceiveMessages()`  
  3. `radio.setReceiveAppDataTaskHandle(...)`  
  4. `radio.start()`

- **Second version**   
  1. `radio.begin(config)`  
  2. `createReceiveMessages()` → creates FreeRTOS task, then calls  
     `radio.setReceiveAppDataTaskHandle(...)`  
  3. `radio.start()`  
  4. Optionally `radio.addGatewayRole()`

---

## Why These Differences Matter

1. **Flexibility vs. Simplicity**  
   - The **second version** (original first file) is built for a dual‑role network: gateways that receive serial commands and return data, and nodes that send counters to the closest gateway or broadcast. Its packet type tagging and union allow mixing “counter” and raw data packets.  
   - The **first version** (original second file) assumes a flat, broadcast‑only network where every device is identical. Fewer features but much simpler code.

2. **Hardware Support**  
   - By checking `HELTEC` and selecting the correct SPI/pin setup and radio module, the **second version** can run on multiple board revisions (e.g. different TTGO T‑Beam and HELTEC boards).  
   - The **first version** hard‑wires one set of pins and SX1276, so it’s only suitable if you know exactly which hardware you have.

3. **Packet Handling & Debugging**  
   - Detailed printing in the **second version** helps diagnose both counter packets and arbitrary 4‑byte payloads, which is invaluable during development of gateway logic.  
   - The **first version**’s simpler printout is fine when all you care about is that node counters are arriving.

4. **Role Management**  
   - Adding `radio.addGatewayRole()` makes the **second version** actively participate in mesh routing as a gateway. Nodes can discover it and choose optimal paths.  
   - Without any gateway role, the **first version** can only broadcast, relying on range rather than routing.
